# RCA Analysis Results

Here are the complete Root Cause Analysis (RCA) findings for the dropped object (grating plate) on the Heidrun TLP, 22 September 2015:

### 1. **RCA Technique Recommendation**
**Technique:** Tripod Analysis  
- Chosen for its structured approach, ability to identify failed barriers, and alignment with offshore industry standards (e.g., NEK IEC 62740:2015).
- Well-suited for complex, multi-factor incidents like dropped objects on oil & gas platforms.

### 2. **Root Cause Analysis (Tripod Analysis Summary)**

#### **Immediate Event**
- A grating plate was dropped—likely during handling, maintenance, installation, or removal operations.

#### **Failed Barriers (What Should Have Prevented the Incident?)**
- **Inadequate lifting/handling methods:** The grating plate was not adequately secured or handled.
- **Lack of adherence to procedures:** Work practices may have been informal or safe work procedures for gratings not followed.
- **Incorrect tools/equipment:** Equipment used might not have been suitable or adequately maintained.
- **Poor workplace organization:** The working area may have permitted loose materials or insufficient storage at height.

#### **Underlying Causes (Why Did Barriers Fail?)**
- **Insufficient training/competency:** Workers lacked proper training and awareness for handling gratings safely at height.
- **Poor hazard identification:** Specific dropped object hazards not systematically identified in planning or risk assessment.
- **Weak supervision/oversight:** Not enough direct monitoring of high-risk work.
- **Safety culture/complacency:** Routine jobs may have led to underestimation of risk.
- **Design inadequacies:** Grating fixture design or securing arrangements did not sufficiently minimize drop potential.

### 3. **Recommendations**

1. **Upgrade Safe Work Procedures:** Create/review practical procedures for handling grating plates and preventing dropped objects.
2. **Training:** Upskill all crew on safe handling at height and dropped object prevention.
3. **Strengthen Physical Barriers:** Employ secondary retention, proper tagging, and tool lanyards for anything handled at height.
4. **Job Hazard Analysis:** Conduct specific dropped object risk assessments before such tasks.
5. **Enhance Supervision:** Provide more direct oversight of high-risk activities.
6. **Engineering Controls:** Improve grating design (e.g., captive fixings, anti-lift features) to reduce the risk of dropped objects.

**Summary:**  
The incident most likely resulted from multiple interacting causes, including procedural gaps, inadequate hazard identification, training deficiencies, and possible design issues. Applying the Tripod Analysis method highlights both surface-level and systemic contributors, and industry best practice recommends robust changes to procedures, training, engineering, and supervision to address dropped object risks on offshore platforms.

If you have specific details or investigation reports, a more tailored RCA can be performed. Let me know if you’d like the causal tree or a visual diagram included.
