# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Report

## Advisor’s Technique Recommendation

**Recommended Technique:** Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram

**Justification:**  
The dropped object incident involves multiple potential contributing factors such as equipment handling, work processes, environmental conditions, and human actions. According to IEC 62740, the Fishbone Diagram is particularly strong for incidents with potentially diverse and interrelated causes, as it visually organizes possible root causes across broad categories (e.g., Method, Equipment, Environment, People). This helps ensure all relevant factors are considered, which is critical for comprehensive analysis in offshore or industrial contexts. The Fishbone approach's clarity and structure make it the most appropriate technique for identifying the underlying causes of such an incident.

## Performer’s Analysis

### Overview

On 22 September 2015, a 31 kg grating plate fell eight metres on the Heidrun TLP during the rig-down following a coiled tubing operation. The incident occurred when an Odim heave compensator, attached to a riser, struck an open deck hatch with attached gratings, knocking off a grating plate. The falling object struck a worker, causing pain and swelling in the shoulder. The kinetic energy just before impact was 2,430 joules. This incident had the potential for far more serious consequences, including fatality or major asset damage.

### Evidence

- Incident occurred during rig-down after coiled tubing operations (well A-54).
- A heave compensator thumped a vertical deck hatch, dislodging a grating plate.
- The plate fell 8 metres, grazing a worker on the hatch deck.
- The worker was wearing a safety harness.
- Potential for object to fall to lower decks with personnel and hydrocarbons present.
- Recent modification history: Deck hatch modified in 2012, but the relevant risk analysis did not cover this hatch/grating arrangement.
- Investigation identified several simultaneous barrier failures:
  - Lack of technical integrity (deck hatch)
  - Inadequate follow-up on previous issues
  - Inadequate identification of risk
  - Unclear roles and responsibilities
  - Deficiencies in governing documentation
- Work team had limited experience with this rig-down scenario; only one member had prior involvement.
- A toolbox talk was conducted, but the team was deployed at three different levels on the structure, with exposure to the drop zone.
- Previous incident (3 days earlier) had already caused some deck hatch deformation.

### Analysis (Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram)

#### 1. Method/Process
- Inadequate planning and risk assessment for the specific rig-down operation.
- Tasks not sequenced to minimize exposure to dropped objects.
- Barriers missing or ineffective: No risk-based, scenario-specific work methods for lifting near grating hatches.
- Inadequate communication around hazard potential of the operation.
- Incomplete or insufficient Step list – ambiguous/inadequate risk assessment.

#### 2. Equipment/Design
- Deck hatch/grating arrangement lacked technical integrity; insufficient attachment strength or design to withstand incidental impact.
- 2012 modification and subsequent risk analysis did not address interaction between moving equipment and vertical grating covers.
- Previous damage (3 days earlier) to the hatch was not sufficiently investigated/remedied.
- The Odim heave compensator movement (likely not designed for interface with such hatches) was not fully controlled.

#### 3. People (Human Factors)
- Inexperience in the crew; only one had done the rig-down before.
- Incomplete transfer of experience and lessons learned.
- Roles and responsibilities for safe rig-down and monitoring hazard zones were unclear.
- Exposure of personnel below gratings during the lifting operation.

#### 4. Environment
- Platform motion (TLP movement) caused unexpected compensator swing, but conditions (weather, waves) were not extreme.
- Off-normal environmental condition not fully considered in the lift planning.

#### 5. Management/System
- Lack of robust governance – deficiencies in procedures, documentation, and follow-up from previous similar incidents.
- Lack of clear accountability for deck hatch technical integrity and work area/barrier coordination.
- Insufficient learning from recent (and similar) events.

### Root Causes

1. **Design/Technical Integrity**
   - The deck hatch and grating lacked adequate robustness and secure attachment for operations involving adjacent heavy lifts and platform motion.

2. **Inadequate Risk Assessment and Planning**
   - The pre-job risk assessment did not account for the potential for impact between the heave compensator and the grating/hatch, nor the recent pre-existing hatch damage.

3. **Organisational Weakness**
   - Roles, responsibilities, and procedural clarity for executing and monitoring this type of operation were not effectively established or communicated.

4. **Human Factors**
   - The majority of the team was inexperienced in this exact operation, and information transfer regarding hazards and previous incidents was ineffective.

5. **Failure to Learn from Past Incidents**
   - A near-miss or precursor event three days prior was not sufficiently investigated, and corrective actions were not implemented before resuming similar work.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Review and Upgrade Deck Hatch/Grating Design**
   - Conduct an engineering review and, if necessary, redesign grating attachment and hatch systems to ensure they can withstand incidental impact during lifting and rigging.

2. **Enhance Risk Assessment Procedures**
   - Update and strengthen risk assessment and job planning processes to specifically address dropped object scenarios, including learning from recent incidents and considering all potential impact sources.

3. **Clarify Roles and Responsibilities**
   - Clearly define responsibilities for deck area supervision, work zone clearance, and operational decision-making during rig-down and lifting operations.

4. **Improve Competency and Communication**
   - Ensure personnel assigned to non-routine or high-risk tasks have the necessary experience/training and that toolbox talks or pre-job briefings include lessons learned/previous incidents.

5. **Establish Stronger Incident Follow-up and Learning**
   - Implement a robust system for tracking, investigating, and closing out near-misses and precursors, making certain corrective actions are implemented before repeating work.

6. **Audit and Improve Governing Documentation**
   - Address gaps and ambiguities in work procedures, technical manuals, and safety documentation related to lifting operations and structural modifications.
